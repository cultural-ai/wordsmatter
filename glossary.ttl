	dcterms:description "The term “Aboriginal” stems from the Latin words ab and origine, meaning “from the beginning”, and is a commonly used word, including in museum databases. “Aboriginal” describes the original inhabitants of a place and is primarily used to refer to Indigenous peoples in Australia and Canada (see also “Indigenous”). However, in Canada, there has been a recent preference for the use of Indigenous. The term does not adequately describe the complexity and diversity of Indigenous peoples. Many Indigenous peoples in both countries do not like to be referred to as “Aboriginal”, preferring to emphasize other markers of their identity such as language, land and clan relationships. In Canada the term came into general use in the 1980s, when a legal and overarching term was sought to collectively describe the existing—but controversial—categories “Indian,” “Inuit” and “Métis” (see also “Indian” and “Eskimo”)."@en ;

The term, which literally means “from another soil/location” (antonym autochtoon) was introduced as an identity category in the Netherlands in the 1970s to replace “immigrant,” which by that time had started to develop negative connotations. While the term itself was intended to be generic and to describe anyone born outside or with one parent born outside the Netherlands, it was split into the subcategories of Western and non-Western, thus creating a distinction between different categories of outsiders. The term has increasingly been used as a stand-in for people who appear to be visibly different, i.e. non-White people. “Allochtoon” has lost favor with some, including policy makers and the public alike, with some municipalities deciding no longer to use the term."@en ;

These words became negatively associated with piracy and the slave trade and the word “barbarian” increasingly gained the meaning of uncivilized.

The term has come to replace the earlier racial category of Negro (see also “Negro”) now regarded as derogatory by many. Within the Netherlands “Black” is used most often to describe people of African or Afro-Caribbean origin. In Britain the term is used similarly; however it has also been used as a socio-political identity category to unite diverse non-White groups of people, regardless of their ethnic or geographical origins, who had suffered racism. This usage is less common in the Netherlands. In the US, the term primarily describes African Americans; “people of color” is also used as a political identity category that includes all non-White people. Rooted primarily in the North American Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, and other global anti-racism struggles, “Black” has become an identity category of pride for many people of African descent, challenging earlier stereotypes associated with Black people."@en ;

The Van Dale dictionary, defines the term as “unblemished” and non-colored. (See “White”, “Black” and “Person of Color”). The association of such ‘neutral’ and even ‘positive’ connotations of the word has generated critique from anti-racist/racial equality activists in the Netherlands, demanding that the word be replaced with the term “White” as a racial and political identity."@en ;

The renaming of places is a common occurrence, both historically and in the present, often resulting from different political shifts over time. This was an important ideological practice, both during the colonial period and during decolonization. This practice continues today. On claiming territory, colonizers named cities and towns after important people or after their own places. Renaming—either restoring earlier names or creating new names— was an important practice for newly formed nations in the decolonization process. The use of names that were assigned under colonization can be painful for some, as a legacy of colonialism. The city of Mumbai continued to be called Bombay until long after independence but was officially changed in 1995. Calcutta (now Kolkata) and Chennai (Madras) are similar colonial toponyms that were Anglicized during the colonial period. Other contested colonial toponyms include: Jakarta (formerly Batavia), Myanmar (formerly Burma) and Zimbabwe (Southern Rhodesia)."@en ;

	dcterms:title "Colored"@en ;
	dcterms:description "“Colored” is a controversial term normally used to describe a person or a group of people with mixed White European and non-White, for example, someone of African or Asian, ancestry. In some cases the term is also used to describe a Black person. The term has different histories of use and meanings within different parts of the world, but is generally regarded as derogatory today. Within South Africa, for example, the term describes someone of mixed ancestry, including Khoisan, Malay, and White. Within the USA the term was used historically to refer primarily to a Black person or the Black community, and is more restrictive than the similar term “person(s)/people of color”. In the Netherlands, the term is used similarly to describe a Black person, or someone of mixed ancestry, with several interrelated Dutch language terms for these identity categories such as: colored (gekleurd), having a bit of color (met een kleurtje) or with a darker skin colour (met een donkerdere huidskleur). The use of these terms harkens back to a racialised idea of whiteness as the norm. These different Dutch terms are all increasingly regarded as inappropriate and derogatory. There is growing acceptance by many for the use of the American identity category “person(s) of color” or “people of color”, abbreviated POC. There is also the more recently emerging group category to more broadly describe non-White people, which is “Black and Non-Black People of Color”. While the terms “Black”, and “person(s) of color” remain generally acceptable terms for many, using the terms that the persons themselves find respectful and acceptable is advised."@en ;

At the beginning of the twentieth century, the term “handicap” was used to describe a person’s “deficit” or inability to function “normally.” Beginning in the 1970s this concept of “deficit” and related words like “handicapped” became increasingly contested. Activists argued that a disability was not an individual problem to solve, but a social construct that made living with an impairment into a problem.

While it was commonly used historically, the term has been criticized for not only reinforcing colonial hierarchies—natives were regarded as inferior to the civilized colonizer—but also (contradictorily) for implying an exclusionary racial and ethnic right to a place by a specific group. The term is currently used by some, for example, Native Americans, in their political claims for sovereignty. Within Europe this concept is increasingly used in xenophobic politics.

In racial thinking the color of one’s skin is regarded as a sign of incommensurable difference between groups, including a hierarchy in aptitude, abilities, even behavior and development. According to 18th- and 19th-century racial sciences, humans were divided into different groups, arranged hierarchically. These typologies reinforced colonial ideologies of difference, with the White European at the top of a racial hierarchy (see also “Caucasian” and “Negro”). While race is not a biological fact, it has social consequences, for example in discrimination, prejudice and inequality. Racism, therefore, should be understood as a form of prejudice and discrimination based on the presumed superiority of one group over another."@en ;

In recent years, the term has come under criticism because of the way it references, often in nostalgic ways, a stable and fixed identity to which people could return. To ask someone about their roots may be problematic for some, as it presupposes that they do not belong or that their roots are the sole or predominant defining factor for their identity.

These interrelated terms describe a person employed in another’s household to do diverse domestic duties such as cooking and cleaning, or to be someone’s attendant. The terms do not in themselves suppose gross exploitation, even if they describe a hierarchical relation in class and power, sometimes marked by exploitation. The multiple and complex relations that servants may have with their masters makes any too easy judgement of the role of the servant or conditions under which they lived an incautious one. “Page” describes a young male servant or attendant, working for a nobleman, or from the Renaissance as servants for fashionable women and men. Referring to someone as servant or page today is regarded as demeaning or insulting in some circles. Maintaining the term in the description of historic paintings and photographs may however be recommended in some situations, especially when the person’s name is not known, since it conveys the power relations more transparently."@en ;

	dcterms:description "The term “slave” is used to describe a person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them by law and/or by force. The term itself refers to different forms of un-freedom, with different meanings and consequences over time and place. In the 6th century, for example, “sklabos” (Greek) meant an un-free person of Slavic descent, while in medieval Latin “sclavus” more generally meant “a person who is owned by another.” Today, the term is more generally used to describe people from Africa who were bought/captured and enslaved by Europeans and forced to work on plantations, often under inhumane conditions, within European colonial projects. Increasingly “slave” has become contested by activists, scholars and the public alike, as it is argued that using the term is to normalize the category “slave” as an inherent identity of a person, thus ignoring that this identity was created not by choice but through violent force. The term also denies the humanity of the person, reducing them to being no more than the property of another. Recently the term has been used to describe the victims of contemporary human trafficking or forced labor."@en ;

This included countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, many of which were formerly colonized by Europe.

Veel inheemse volken in beide landen willen geen ‘Aboriginal’ genoemd worden en geven de voorkeur aan andere termen die hun identiteit kenmerken, zoals taal, land en clan relaties. In Canada begon men de term toe te passen in de jaren 1980, toen men een juridische en overkoepelende term zocht om de bestaande – maar controversiële – categorieën ‘indiaan’, ‘Inuit’ en ‘Métis’ te beschrijven (zie: Indiaan en Eskimo)."@nl ;

Het werd in de jaren 1970 in Nederland geïntroduceerd als identiteitscategorie, ter vervanging voor ‘immigrant' dat in die tijd een steeds negatievere connotatie kreeg. De term was bedoeld als generieke term om iemand te benoemen die zelf, of waarvan een ouder buiten Nederland geboren was. De term werd echter gesplitst in de subcategorieën ‘westerse’ en ‘niet­westerse’ allochtonen, waarmee een onderscheid gemaakt werd tussen verschillende categorieën buitenstaanders. De term is geleidelijk aan meer en meer gebruikt als synoniem voor mensen die zichtbaar anders lijken, bijvoorbeeld niet­witte mensen. De term is impopulair geworden bij zowel beleidsmakers als het publiek en sommige gemeentes hebben zelfs besloten om het woord niet meer te gebruiken."@nl ;

De term ‘page' beschrijft een jonge, mannelijke bediende die voor een edelman werkt, of – wanneer het de Renaissance betreft ­ als bediende voor modieuze dames en heren.

De term werd voor het eerst gebruikt in de 16de eeuw. Het hernoemen van plaatsen komt vaak voor, zowel vroeger als nu, en vaak vanwege politieke veranderingen. Zowel onder kolonialisme als tijdens dekolonisatie, maar ook nu nog, is dit een belangrijke ideologie. Koloniale overheersers noemden steden en andere plaatsen naar belangrijke figuren of plekken uit eigen land. Het hernoemen van plekken – dan wel door nieuwe namen te geven dan wel oude namen in ere te herstellen – is een belangrijk symbool voor nieuwe naties. De naam uit het koloniale tijdperk kan voor sommige inwoners beledigend zijn, omdat het een pijnlijke herinnering is aan het kolonialisme. Ook toen Mumbai onafhankelijk was geworden, bleef men het nog lang Bombay noemen. Calcutta (nu Kolkata) en Chennai (Madras) zijn vergelijkbare voorbeelden van koloniale toponiemen die verengelst werden tijdens de koloniale periode. Andere koloniale toponiemen zijn onder meer: Jakarta (Batavia), Myanmar (Birma) en Zimbabwe (Zuid­-Rhodesië)."@nl ;

De term werd ook een economische indeling, die werd gebruikt om te verwijzen naar de armste landen en regio's van de wereld. Dit omvatte landen in Azië, Afrika, Latijns­Amerika en het Caribisch gebied, waarvan er velen voorheen door Europa waren gekoloniseerd.

Bloed, zo dacht men toen, was de drager van hiërarchische eigenschappen, waarbij het ene soort bloed superieur was aan andere soorten. De term wordt meestal gebruikt voor mensen met een gemengde afkomst, namelijk wit en Europees, en niet­-wit.

Vanaf de jaren zeventig werden dit concept en daaraan gerelateerde woorden steeds meer bekritiseerd. Activisten voerden aan dat een beperking geen individueel probleem was dat moest worden verholpen, maar dat het de samenleving was die het leven met een beperking tot een probleem maakte.

In de 19de eeuw werden Khoikhoi mensen met geweld uitgebuit. Ook werden ze tentoongesteld, als illustratie van een primitief type. Eerst als entertainment, maar later in het kader van wetenschappelijke koloniale kennis. Een bekend voorbeeld was de zogenaamde Hottentot Venus, Sarah Baartman, die vanaf 1810­-1815 in Europa werd getoond.

De term is ouderwets en wordt in sommige situaties beschouwd als beledigend, zoals dat ook het geval is met de andere zogenaamde rassencategorieën ‘Kaukasisch’ en ‘neger’ (zie: Kaukasisch en Neger). De term wordt ook gebruikt voor mensen met het Downsyndroom, omdat hun gelaatstrekken een gelijkenis zouden vertonen met die van mensen van het zogenaamde Mongoolse ras.

Net als de raciale wetenschappen waaruit de term voortkwam, suggereert ‘mulat' een fundamenteel verschil tussen twee menselijke soorten. Dit resulteert, net als bij de muilezel, in een abnormaal nageslacht waarvan verondersteld wordt dat het onvruchtbaar is. Er werd gedacht dat mulatten de ‘verschrikkingen’ van vermenging vertegen­ woordigden (zie: Halfbloed), maar vanwege hun zogenaamd witte bloed vond men dat ze intelligenter waren - ­en vaak aantrekkelijker ­- dan Zwarte mensen.

Volgens 18de­- en 19de­-eeuwse raciale wetenschappers was het mogelijk om mensen in verschillende groepen te verdelen en in een hiërarchie te plaatsen. Deze typologieën versterkten koloniale ideologieën over verschil, met de witte Europeaan aan de top in een raciale hiërarchie (zie: Kaukasisch en Neger). Hoewel ras geen biologisch feit is, heeft het sociale gevolgen, zoals discriminatie, vooroordelen en ongelijkheid.

In de 6de eeuw betekende sklabos (Grieks) bijvoorbeeld een onvrij persoon van Slavische afkomst, terwijl sclavus in het middeleeuwse Latijn juist de meer algemene betekenis had van ‘een persoon die eigendom is van een ander’. Vandaag de dag wordt de term gebruikt voor mensen uit Afrika die door Europeanen gekocht/gevangen genomen werden en vervolgens gedwongen werden om onder onmenselijke omstandigheden op koloniale plantages te werken. Recent wordt de term gebruikt om de slachtoffers van hedendaagse mensenhandel of dwangarbeid te beschrijven. De term ‘slaaf’ wordt steeds meer betwist door activisten, weten­ schappers en het publiek. Men vindt dat het gebruik van de term ‘slaaf’ een categorie normaliseert die niet inherent is aan iemands identiteit. De categorie werd onder geweld en dwang opgelegd, en was dus geen eigen keuze.

	dcterms:description "Het ‘westen’ is een ideologisch, historisch, economisch en geografisch concept waarvan de betekenis in de loop der tijd is veranderd. De term ‘westers’ staat voor een mentale en fysieke scheiding van de wereld waarin mensen, culturen, religies en regio's in een hiërarchie van categorieën zijn ingedeeld en wat de onderlinge verschillen onderstreept. De term wordt vaak gebruikt om de tegenstelling met ‘niet­-westers’ aan te duiden. Andere termen met vergelijkbare connotaties zijn onder andere ‘Derde Wereld’ (zie: Derde Wereld), ontwikkeld/onontwikkeld, etc."@nl ;

	dcterms:description "‘Wit’ is lange tijd gebruikt om een raciale identiteit te beschrijven op basis van huidskleur, meestal voor bepaalde groepen Europeanen en hun emigrantenpopulatie over de hele wereld. De term wordt geassocieerd met de raciale wetenschappen in de 18de en 19de eeuw. ‘Wit’ is een ideologische categorie die onder meer geassocieerd wordt met Europa’s imperiale expansie. De term heeft de connotatie gekregen van vooruitgang, verfijning en ontwikkeld. Sinds het einde van de 20ste eeuw is er echter aanhoudende kritiek op deze sociale constructie van wit­-zijn als norm. Men verzet zich tegen ‘wit’ als identiteitscategorie, die ontstaan is als een rechtvaardiging en bekrachtiging van het discrimineren van niet­witte mensen. In Nederland is er naast de toenemende kritiek op wit­zijn discussie over de vraag of men het woord ‘wit’ of ‘blank’ (zie: Blank) moet gebruiken."@nl ;

In samenhang met hun rondreizende bestaan en vanwege hun verleden van (gedwongen) migratie, blijft de negatieve stereotypering van de Roma als dieven en zwervers bestaan. De Roma beschouwen de term ‘zigeuner’ als denigrerend en in de jaren 1970 hebben ze daarom gezamenlijk en officieel besloten om zichzelf ‘Roma’ te noemen."@nl ;

De term is de vroegere raciale categorie ‘neger’ (zie: Neger) gaan vervangen, die nu door velen beschouwd wordt als denigrerend. In Nederland wordt ‘Zwart’ het meest gebruikt om mensen van Afrikaanse of Afro­-Caribische oorsprong te beschrijven. Op deze manier gebeurt dit ook in Groot­-Brittannië. Daar wordt de term echter ook gebruikt als verschillende niet­witte groepen mensen te verenigen, die allen racistisch bejegend worden (ongeacht hun etnische of geografische afkomst). In Nederland is dat in mindere mate het geval. Ook in de Verenigde Staten verwijst de term vooral naar Afro­-Amerikanen: ‘mensen van kleur’ wordt gebruikt als een politieke categorie voor iedereen die niet wit is. Met name door de inspanningen van de Noord­-Amerikaanse Civil Rights en Black Power bewegingen, maar ook door de strijd tegen racisme wereldwijd, is ‘Zwart’ een identiteitscategorie geworden waar veel mensen van Afrikaanse afkomst trots op zijn. Daarmee neemt men afstand van eerdere stereotypen waarmee Zwarte mensen geassocieerd worden."@nl ;
