The thesaurus was downloaded from the website of The Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen (NMVW) on 15.11.2022.
[The download page](https://collectie.wereldculturen.nl/thesaurus).
The downloaded repository contained 44 files in RDF/XML format.

The Jupyter Notebook [querying_nmvw_thesaurus.ipynb](https://github.com/cultural-ai/wordsmatter/blob/main/NMVW/querying_nmvw_thesaurus.ipynb) merges the 44 files into a single json file [nmvw_thesaurus.json](https://github.com/cultural-ai/wordsmatter/blob/main/NMVW/nmvw_thesaurus.json.zip), in which we searched for occurences of contentious terms in the literal values of the thesaurus concepts.
The query results are put in the csv file [cont_terms_in_NMVW.csv](https://github.com/cultural-ai/wordsmatter/blob/main/NMVW/cont_terms_in_NMVW.csv)
